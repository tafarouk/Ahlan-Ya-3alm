For opening and closing files


with open('data.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()
    
    Unpacking sequences

p = 'Raymond', 'Hettinger', 0x30, 'python@example.com'

# A common approach / habit from other languages
fname = p[0]
lname = p[1]
age = p[2]
email = p[3]
Better

fname, lname, age, email = p
The second approach uses tuple unpacking and is faster and more readable.
